AI-Powered Cultural & Linguistic Atlas of India
==================================================

This is a demo project scaffold created from the provided project brief.
It includes a Flask backend (with mocked AI modules), a simple Leaflet frontend,
a small dataset, and placeholder audio samples (tiny silent WAV files).

How to run (demo):
- Backend: python backend/app.py
- Frontend: open frontend/index.html in your browser
- The backend uses mocked AI functions (no large model downloads).
- PostgreSQL/PostGIS integration is indicated but not required for the demo.

Contents:
- backend/: Flask app + mocked AI modules
- frontend/: static site using Leaflet.js
- dataset/: small CSVs and audio samples
- README.md (this file)

Note: For full production usage, integrate real AI models (Whisper, fastText, Aksharantar)
and a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. See the project brief for sources.
